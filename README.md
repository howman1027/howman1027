### Hey there! 👋 I'm @howman1027  

I'm a backend engine developer with a strong focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Computer Vision**. While backend systems are my specialty, I’m also open to front-end development, exploring how to create seamless and intuitive user experiences powered by AI.  

### 🛠 What I Do  
By day, I architect and develop backend systems that handle everything from real-time messaging to complex transaction processing. By night, I’m diving into the world of **LLMs and computer vision**, experimenting with new models, fine-tuning architectures, and exploring how AI can push the boundaries of what’s possible.  

### 🚀 What Excites Me  
I love working on:  
- **LLMs & NLP** – Enhancing language models, improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and making AI more context-aware.  
- **Computer Vision** – Teaching machines to see and interpret the world more effectively.  
- **Blockchain & Decentralized Tech** – Building secure and transparent digital systems.  
- **Scalable Backend Architecture** – Optimizing performance for large-scale applications using message queues like RabbitMQ.  
- **Front-End Development** – Exploring how AI-driven applications can deliver intuitive and engaging user experiences.  

### 🤝 Let’s Collaborate  
I’m always open to new ideas, whether it’s fine-tuning an AI model, scaling up a backend service, integrating blockchain into real-world applications, or improving front-end experiences with AI. If you’re working on something exciting in **AI, backend systems, front-end development, or blockchain**, let’s connect!
